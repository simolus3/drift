/// run the build runner using (flutter packages) pub run build_runner build.
/// Moor will have generated a class that has the same name as your database
/// class, but with `_$` as a prefix. You can now extend that class and provide
/// a [QueryEngine] to use moor:
/// ```dart
/// class MyDatabase extends _$MyDatabase { // _$MyDatabase was generated

///     super(FlutterQueryExecutor.inDatabaseFolder(path: 'path.db'));
/// }
/// ```

  /// regular database class, making is suitable to extract parts of your
  /// database logic into smaller components.
  ///
  /// For instructions on how to write a dao, see the documentation of [UseDao]

  /// {@template moor_compile_queries_param}
  /// Optionally, a list of named sql queries. During a build, moor will look at
  /// the defined sql, figure out what they do, and write appropriate
  /// methods in your generated database.
  ///
  /// For instance, when using
  /// ```dart
  /// @UseMoor(
  ///   tables: [Users],
  ///   queries: {
  ///     'userById': 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?',
  ///   },

///
/// To write a dao, you'll first have to write a database class. See [UseMoor]
/// for instructions on how to do that. Then, create an empty class that is
/// annotated with [UseDao] and that extends [DatabaseAccessor]. For instance,
/// if you have a class called `MyDatabase`, this could look like this:
/// ```dart
/// class MyDao extends DatabaseAccessor<MyDatabase> {
///   MyDao(MyDatabase db) : super(db);
/// }

/// After having run the build step once more, moor will have generated a mixin
/// called `_$MyDaoMixin`. Change your class definition to
/// `class MyDao extends DatabaseAccessor<MyDatabase> with _$MyDaoMixin` and
/// you're ready to make queries inside your dao. You can obtain an instance of
/// that dao by using the getter that will be generated inside your database
/// class.
