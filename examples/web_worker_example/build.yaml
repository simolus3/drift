targets:
  # This setup exists so that the main entrypoint (web/main.dart) gets compiled
  # with dartdevc for debug builds while the worker is compiled with dart2js
  # (since workers don't support the JS moduled emitted by dartdevc).
  # In release builds (`--release` on the CLI), both entrypoints are compiled
  # with dart2js.
  #
  # If you're ok with compiling everything with dart2js, just use
  # `compiler: dartj2s` on the options of the default target and ignore the two
  # additional targets here.
