## 2.19.0-dev

- Add `exclusively` method to database classes, allowing a block to temporarily
  take exclusive control over a database connection without starting a
  transaction.
- Add the `enableMigrations` parameter to `WasmDatabase` to control whether drift
  migrations are enabled on that database.
- Add `initiallyDeferred` option to `references()` column builder for foreign
  key constraints.
- Add `dropColumn` method to `Migrator`.

## 2.18.0

- Adds a new interface for writing most simple statements without manually creating
  select statements and expressions.
  For a detailed description, see the [documentation website](https://drift.simonbinder.eu/docs/manager/).
  This feature requires additional code to be generated - if you prefer using the existing APIs
  exclusively, you can use the [`generate_manager: false` builder option](https://drift.simonbinder.eu/docs/advanced-features/builder_options/)
- Add `AggregateFunctionExpression` to write custom [aggregate function](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html)
  invocations in the Dart query builder.
- The `json_group_array` and `jsonb_group_array` functions now contain an `orderBy`
  and `filter` parameter.

## 2.17.0

- Adds `companion` entry to `DataClassName` to override the name of the
  generated companion class.
- Add the `TypeConverter.extensionType` factory to create type converters for
  extension types.
- Fix invalid SQL syntax being generated for `BLOB` literals on postgres.

## 2.16.0

- When a migration throws, the database will now block subsequent operations
  instead of potentially allowing them to operate on a database in an
  inconsistent state.
- Statements built through the Dart query builder will now run in the context
  active while they are running, instead of the context active at the time they
  were created. For instance, creating an `UpdateStatement` with
  `database.update` outside of a transaction and then calling
  `UpdateStatement.write` inside of a transaction will now perform the update
  inside of the transaction, instead of causing a deadlock.
- Improve stack traces for errors happening on drift isolates (which includes
  usages of `NativeDatabase.createInBackground`).
- Don't cache `EXPLAIN` statements, avoiding schema locks.
- Deprecate `Value.ofNullable` in favor of `Value.absentIfNull`, which is more
  explicit about its behavior and allows nullable types too.
- Migrate `WasmDatabase` to `dart:js_interop` and `package:web`.

## 2.15.0

- Methods in the query builder API now respect custom types.
- Support `DialectAwareSqlType`, custom types that depend on the dialect of the
  active database connection. This can be used to use native types not
  supported by drift (like UUIDs) on databases that support it while falling
  back to a text type on sqlite3.
- Close wasm databases hosted in workers after the last client disconnects.
- Add `enableMigrations` parameter to `NativeDatabase` which can be used to
  optionally disable database migrations when opening databases.
- Support `jsonb` functions in the Dart query builder.

## 2.14.1

- Fix `WasmProbeResult.open` ignoring the `Ã¬nitializeDatabase` callback.

## 2.14.0

- Add the `QueryInterceptor` API to easily monitor or transform all database
  calls made by drift.
- Add the `count()` extension on tables to easily count rows in tables or views.

## 2.13.2

- Fix a race condition causing query streams to not emit new data around some
  transaction setups.

## 2.13.1

- Fix a bug when running batches over serialized communication channels.

## 2.13.0

- Add APIs to setup Wasm databases with custom drift workers.
- Add support for [custom types](https://drift.simonbinder.eu/docs/sql-api/types/),
  which are useful when extending drift to support other database engines.
- Drift now provides a DevTools extension embedding the drift inspector written by
  [Koen Van Looveren](https://github.com/vanlooverenkoen/).
- Add `Expression.and` and `Expression.or` to create disjunctions and conjunctions
  of sub-predicates.
- Step-by-step migrations now save the intermediate schema version after each step.

## 2.12.1

- Fix `readWithConverter` throwing an exception for null values in non-
  nullable columns.

## 2.12.0

- Add support for table-valued functions in the Dart query builder.
- Add the `@TableIndex` annotation for table classes to add an index to the
  table.
- Support `json_each` and `json_tree`.
- Add the `TypeConverter.json` method to define type converters storing JSON
  values more easily.
- Add `TypedResult.readWithConverter` to read a column with a type converter
  from a join result row.

## 2.11.1

- Allow using `.read()` for a column added to a join from the table, fixing a
  regression in drift 2.11.0.
- Make step-by-step migrations easier to customize with `Migrator.runMigrationSteps`.

## 2.11.0

- Add support for subqueries in the Dart query builder.
- Add `isInExp` and `isNotInExp` to construct `IS IN` expressions with arbitrary
  expressions.
- Add the `substr` extension on `Expression<String>` to call the sqlite3 function from
  the Dart API.
- Add `isolateSetup` to `NativeDatabase.createInBackground()` to override native libraries
  or perform other database-unrelated setup work.
- Add `WasmDatabase.probe()`, a method probing for available implementations and existing
  databases on the web without opening one directly.

## 2.10.0

- Adds the `schema steps` command to `drift_dev`. It generates an API making it
  easier to write safe schema migrations ([docs](https://drift.simonbinder.eu/docs/advanced-features/migrations/#step-by-step)).
- Fix drift WASM not being unusable after a previous database implementation becomes
  unavailable in the browser.

## 2.9.0

- Forbid `schemaVersion` returning `0`, as this causes issues in the migrator.
- Drift web support is now stable! By using a `WasmDatabase.open` factory as
  described in https://drift.simonbinder.eu/web/, you can run a drift database
  in modern browsers!

## 2.8.2

- Fix prepared statements leaking when the statement cache is disabled.
- Disable prepared statement caching by default.

## 2.8.1

- Performance improvement: Cache and re-use prepared statements - thanks to [@davidmartos96](https://github.com/davidmartos96/)
- Fix a deadlock after rolling back a transaction in a remote isolate.
- Remove unintended log messages when using `connectToDriftWorker`.

## 2.8.0

- Don't keep databases in an unusable state if the `setup` callback throws an
  exception. Instead, drift will retry the next time the database is used.
- Allow targeting partial indices in `DoUpdate` ([#2394](https://github.com/simolus3/drift/issues/2394))
- Fix deadlocks when `computeWithDatabase` is called inside a `transaction()`.

## 2.7.0

- Add support for `CASE` expressions without a base in the Dart API with the
  `CaseWhenExpression` class.
- Add the new `package:drift/web/workers.dart` library which makes it easier to
  create web workers for drift.

## 2.6.0

- Add `insertReturningOrNull` for potentially empty inserts.
- Add `insertFromSelect` to `InsertStatement` to run `INSERT INTO SELECT`
  statements.
- Add `rowid` parameter to companions for tables with rowids that don't have a
  visible alias for the rowid.
- After opening a database with a higher schema version than the current one set
  in the database class, the schema version in the database will now be downgraded.
- When using a drift isolate in the same engine group, errors on the remote end are
  reported directly instead of wrapping them in a `DriftRemoteException`.
- Added support for `DO NOTHING` during upsert operations with constraint violations

## 2.5.0

- Add `isExp`, `isValue`, `isNotExp` and `isNotValue` methods to `Expression`
  to generate the `IS` operator in SQL.
- Add `all()` extension on tables and views to quickly query all rows.
- Add `serializableConnection()` and `computeWithDatabase()` as extensions on
  databases. The methods allow sharing any drift database between isolates,
  regardless of how the database has been set up.
- The `DatabaseConnection` class now implements `QueryExecutor`, meaning that
  you no longer need a special `.connect()` constructor to use it.

## 2.4.2

- Fix an exception when a client disconnects from a drift remote server while
  processing a pending table update.

## 2.4.1

- Fix `DriftIsolate` leaking resources for closed connections.

## 2.4.0

- Add `textEnum` column builder and `EnumNameConverter` to be able to store enum
  values as string.
- Add `updates` parameter to `Batch.customStatement` - it can be used to specify
  which tables are affected by the custom statement.
- For `STRICT` tables in drift files declaring a `ANY` column, drift will now
  generate a mapping to the new `DriftAny` type.
- Add `likeExp` to generate `LIKE` expression with any comparison expression.
- Fix `UNIQUE` keys declared in drift files being written twice.
- Fix `customConstraints` not appearing in dumped database schema files.
- Lazily load columns in `TypedResult.read`, increasing performance for joins
  with lots of tables or columns.
- Work-around an issue causing complex migrations via `Migrator.alterTable` not to
  work if a view referenced the altered table.

## 2.3.0

- Add the `JsonTypeConverter2` mixin. It behaves similar to the existing json
  type converters, but can use a different SQL and JSON type.
- Add `isInValues` and `isNotInValues` methods to columns with type converters.
  They can be used to compare the column against a list of Dart expressions that
  will be mapped through a type converter.
- Add `TableStatements.insertAll` to atomically insert multiple rows.
- Add `singleClientMode` to `remote()` and `DriftIsolate` connections to make
  the common case with one client more efficient.
- Fix a concurrency issue around transactions.
- Add `NativeDatabase.createInBackground` as a drop-in replacement for
  `NativeDatabase`. It creates a drift isolate behind the scenes, avoiding all
  of the boilerplate usually involved with drift isolates.
- __Experimental__: Add a [modular generation mode](https://drift.simonbinder.eu/docs/advanced-features/builder_options/#enabling-modular-code-generation)
  in which drift will generate multiple smaller files instead of one very large
  one with all tables and generated queries.

## 2.2.0

- Always escape column names, avoiding the costs of using a regular expression
  to check whether they need to be escaped.
- Add extensions for binary methods on integer expressions: `operator ~`,
  `bitwiseAnd` and `bitwiseOr`.

## 2.1.0

- Improve stack traces when using `watchSingle()` with a stream emitting a non-
  singleton list at some point.
- Add `OrderingTerm.nulls` to control the `NULLS FIRST` or `NULLS LAST` clause
  in Dart.

## 2.0.2+1

- Revert the breaking change around `QueryRow.read` only returning non-nullable
  values now - it was causing issues with type inference in some cases.

## 2.0.1

- Fix an error when inserting a null value into a nullable column defined with
  additional checks in Dart.

## 2.0.0

ð¡: More information on how to migrate is available in the [documentation](https://drift.simonbinder.eu/docs/upgrading/).

- __Breaking__: Type converters now return the types that they were defined to return
  (instead of the nullable variant of those types like before).
  It is an error to use a non-nullable type converter on a column that is nullable in
  SQL and vice-versa.
- __Breaking__: Mapping methods on type converters are now called `toSql` and `fromSql`.
- __Breaking__: Removed `SqlTypeSystem` and subtypes of `SqlType`:
  - To describe the type a column has, use the `DriftSqlType` enum
  - To map a value from Dart to SQL and vice-versa, use an instance of `SqlTypes`,
    reachable via `database.options.types`.
- __Breaking__: `Expression`s (including `Column`s) always have a non-nullable type
  parameter now. They are implicitly nullable, so `TypedResult.read` now returns a
  nullable value.
- __Breaking__: `QueryRow.read` can only read non-nullable values now. To read nullable
  values, use `readNullable`.
- __Breaking__: Remove the `includeJoinedTableColumns` parameter on `selectOnly()`.
  The method now behaves as if that parameter was turned off. To use columns from a
  joined table, add them with `addColumns`.
- __Breaking__: Remove the `fromData` factory on generated data classes. Use the
  `map` method on tables instead.
- Add support for storing date times as (ISO-8601) strings. For details on how
  to use this, see [the documentation](https://drift.simonbinder.eu/docs/getting-started/advanced_dart_tables/#supported-column-types).
- Consistently handle transaction errors like a failing `BEGIN` or `COMMIT`
  across database implementations.
- Add `writeReturning` to update statements; `deleteReturning` and `goAndReturn`
  to delete statatements.
- Support nested transactions.
- Support custom collations in the query builder API.
- [Custom row classes](https://drift.simonbinder.eu/docs/advanced-features/custom_row_classes/)
  can now be constructed with static methods too.
  These static factories can also be asynchronous.

## 1.7.1

- Fix the `NativeDatabase` not disposing statements if running them threw an
  exception [#1917](https://github.com/simolus3/drift/issues/1917).

## 1.7.0

- Add the `int64()` column builder to store large integers. These integers are
  still stored as 64-bit ints in the database, but represented as a `BigInt` in
  Dart. This enables better web support for integers larger than 2^52.
  More details are in [the documentation](https://drift.simonbinder.eu/docs/getting-started/advanced_dart_tables/#bigint-support).
- Add `filter` and `distinct` support to `groupConcat`.
- Fix a deadlock with the `sqflite`-based implementation if the first operation
  in a `transaction` is a future backed by a query stream.

## 1.6.0

- Add the `unique()` method to columns and the `uniqueKeys` override for tables
  to define unique constraints in Dart tables.
- Add the `check()` method to the Dart column builder to generate `CHECK` column
  constraints.
- Also apply type converters for json serialization and deserialization if they
  mix in `JsonTypeConverter`.
- Add the very experimental `package:drift/wasm.dart` library. It uses WebAssembly
  to access sqlite3 without any external JavaScript libraries, but requires you to
  add a [WebAssembly module](https://github.com/simolus3/sqlite3.dart/tree/main/sqlite3#wasm-web-support)
  to the `web/` folder.
  Please note that this specific library is not subject to semantic versioning
  until it leaves its experimental state. It also isn't suitable for production
  use at the moment.
- Internally use `package:js` to wrap sql.js.

## 1.5.0

- Add `DataClassName.extending` to control the superclass of generated row
  classes.
- Add `setup` parameter to the constructors of `WebDatabase` too.
- Don't write variables for expressions in `CREATE VIEW` statements.
- Improve stack traces for errors on a remote isolate.
- Add `MultiExecutor.withReadPool` constructor to load-balance between multiple
  reading executors. This can be used in a multi-isolate approach if some
  queries are expensive.


## 1.4.0

- Most methods to compose statements are now available as an extension on
  tables. As an alternative to `update(todos).replace(newEntry)`, you can
  now write `todos.replaceOne(newEntry)`.
- Deprecate the `from(table)` API introduced in 1.3.0. Having the methods on
  the table instances turned out to be even easier!
- In drift files, you can now use `LIST(SELECT ...)` as a result column to
  get all results of the inner select as a `List` in the result set.

## 1.3.0

- Add the `from(table)` method to generated databases. It can be used to write
  common queries more concisely.
- Make `groupConcat` nullable in the Dart API.
- Throw an exception in a `NativeDatabase` when multiple statements are run in
  a single call. In previous versions, parts of the SQL string would otherwise
  be ignored.
- Close the underlying database when a drift isolate is shut down.

## 1.2.0

- Properly support stream update queries on views.
- Reading blobs from the database is more lenient now.
- Provide a stack trace when `getSingle()` or `watchSingle()` is used on a
  query emitting more than one row.

## 1.1.1

- Rollback transactions when a commit fails.
- Revert a change from 1.1.0 to stop serializing messages over isolates.
  Instead, please set the `serialize` parameter to `false` on the `DriftIsolate` methods.

## 1.1.0

- Add the `references` method to `BuildColumn` to reference a column declared
  in another Dart table.
- Add the `generateInsertable` option to `@UseRowClass`. When enabled, the generator
  will emit an extension to use the row class as an `Insertable`.
  Thanks to [@westito](https://github.com/westito).
- Allow the generator to emit correct SQL code when using arrays with the
  `new_sql_code_generation` option in specific scenarios.
- Add support for [strict tables](https://sqlite.org/stricttables.html) in `.drift` files.
- Add the `generatedAs` method to declare generated columns for Dart tables.
- Add `OrderingTerm.random` to fetch rows in a random order.
- Improved support for pausing query stream subscriptions. Instead of buffering events,
  query streams will suspend fetching data if all listeners are paused.
- Drift isolates no longer serialize messages into a primitive format. This will reduce
  the overhead of using isolates with Drift.

## 1.0.1

- Add `DoUpdate.withExcluded` to refer to the excluded row in an upsert clause.
- Add optional `where` clause to `DoUpdate` constructors

This is the initial release of the `drift` package (formally known as `moor`).
For an overview of old `moor` releases, see its [changelog](https://pub.dev/packages/moor/changelog).
