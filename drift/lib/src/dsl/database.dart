/// Drift will have generated a class that has the same name as your database
/// class, but with `_$` as a prefix. You can now extend that class and provide
/// a [QueryExecutor] to use drift:
/// ```dart
/// class MyDatabase extends _$MyDatabase { // _$MyDatabase was generated

  /// regular database class, making is suitable to extract parts of your
  /// database logic into smaller components.

  /// For instructions on how to write a dao, see the documentation of

  /// at the defined sql, figure out what they do, and write appropriate

  /// For instance, when using

  /// @DriftDatabase(
  ///   tables: [Users],
  ///   queries: {
  ///     'userById': 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?',
  ///   },

/// To write a dao, you'll first have to write a database class. See

/// class that is annotated with [DriftAccessor] and extends [DatabaseAccessor].
