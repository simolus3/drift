Integration tests for `package:drift/native.dart`.

To run the tests automatically (with us managing a browser driver), just run `dart test`.

To manually debug issues, it might make sense to trigger some functionality manually.
You can run `dart run tool/server_manually.dart` to start a web server hosting the test
content on http://localhost:8080.
