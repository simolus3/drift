# Short description for each builder

#  - preparing_builder: Infers the type of inline Dart expressions in moor files.
#    We create a `input.temp.dart` file containing the expressions so that they
#    can be resolved.
#  - moor_generator: The regular SharedPartBuilder for @UseMoor and @UseDao
#    annotations
#  - moor_generator_not_shared: Like moor_generator, but as a PartBuilder instead of
#    a SharedPartBuilder. This builder is disabled by default, but users may choose
#    to use it so that generated classes can be used by other builders.
#  - moor_cleanup: Deletes the `.temp.dart` files generated by the `preparing_builder`.
