## 2.2.0-dev

- __Potentially breaking bug-fix__: Fix the nullability of columns generated for
  Dart-defined views.
- Serialize `uniqueKeys` overrides into a database schema.
- Support latest version of the `analyzer` package.

## 2.1.0

- Analysis support `fts5` tables with external content tables.
- Analysis support for the `rtree` module.
- Prepare for an upcoming breaking analyzer change around how classes are mapped
  to elements.

## 2.0.2

- Generate public typedefs for the signatures of `scoped_dart_components`,
  making it easier to re-use them for own methods.

## 2.0.1

- Recognize options for an applied `not_shared` builder when exporting schemas.

## 2.0.0

- Removes the following build options, which are always turned on now:
 - `null_aware_type_converters`
 - `new_sql_code_generation`
 - `compact_query_methods`
- Starting from this version, drift only supports generating non-nullable Dart code.
  You'll have to at least opt your database code into null-safety to use this and
  upcoming drift releases.

These changes help reduce complexity in the generator.

## 1.7.1

- Support the latest versions of the `analyzer` and `analyzer_plugin` packages.

## 1.7.0

- Emit correct SQL code when using arrays with the `new_sql_code_generation`
  option in specific scenarios.
- Transform `.moor.dart` part files in the `migrate` command.
