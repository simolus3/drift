## Adding the dependency
First, lets add drift to your project's `pubspec.yaml`.
At the moment, the current version of `drift` is [![Drift version](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/drift.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/drift)
and the latest version of `drift_dev` is [![Generator version](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/drift_dev.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/drift_dev).

{% assign versions = 'package:moor_documentation/versions.json' | readString | json_decode %}

```yaml
dependencies:
  drift: ^{{ versions.drift }}
  sqlite3_flutter_libs: ^0.5.0
  path_provider: ^2.0.0
  path: ^{{ versions.path }}

dev_dependencies:
  drift_dev: ^{{ versions.drift_dev }}
  build_runner: ^{{ versions.build_runner }}
```

If you're wondering why so many packages are necessary, here's a quick overview over what each package does:

- `drift`: This is the core package defining most apis
- `sqlite3_flutter_libs`: Ships the latest `sqlite3` version with your Android or iOS app. This is not required when you're _not_ using Flutter,
  but then you need to take care of including `sqlite3` yourself.
- `path_provider` and `path`: Used to find a suitable location to store the database. Maintained by the Flutter and Dart team
- `drift_dev`: This development-only dependency generates query code based on your tables. It will not be included in your final app.
- `build_runner`: Common tool for code-generation, maintained by the Dart team

### Declaring tables
Using drift, you can model the structure of your tables with simple dart code:
```dart
import 'package:drift/drift.dart';

// assuming that your file is called filename.dart. This will give an error at first,
// but it's needed for drift to know about the generated code
part 'filename.g.dart';

// this will generate a table called "todos" for us. The rows of that table will
// be represented by a class called "Todo".
class Todos extends Table {
  IntColumn get id => integer().autoIncrement()();
  TextColumn get title => text().withLength(min: 6, max: 32)();
  TextColumn get content => text().named('body')();
  IntColumn get category => integer().nullable()();
}

// This will make drift generate a class called "Category" to represent a row in this table.
// By default, "Categorie" would have been used because it only strips away the trailing "s"
// in the table name.
@DataClassName("Category")
class Categories extends Table {
  
  IntColumn get id => integer().autoIncrement()();
  TextColumn get description => text()();
}

// this annotation tells drift to prepare a database class that uses both of the
// tables we just defined. We'll see how to use that database class in a moment.
@DriftDatabase(tables: [Todos, Categories])
class MyDatabase {
  
}
```

__⚠️ Note:__ The column definitions, the table name and the primary key must be known at
compile time. For column definitions and the primary key, the function must use the `=>`
operator and can't contain anything more than what's included in the documentation and the
examples. Otherwise, the generator won't be able to know what's going on.

## Generating the code
Drift integrates with Dart's `build` system, so you can generate all the code needed with 
`flutter packages pub run build_runner build`. If you want to continuously rebuild the generated code
where you change your code, run `flutter packages pub run build_runner watch` instead.
After running either command once, the drift generator will have created a class for your
database and data classes for your entities. To use it, change the `MyDatabase` class as
follows:
```dart
// These imports are only needed to open the database
import 'package:drift/native.dart';
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
import 'package:path/path.dart' as p;
import 'package:drift/drift.dart';
import 'dart:io';

LazyDatabase _openConnection() {
  // the LazyDatabase util lets us find the right location for the file async.
  return LazyDatabase(() async {
    // put the database file, called db.sqlite here, into the documents folder
    // for your app.
    final dbFolder = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
    final file = File(p.join(dbFolder.path, 'db.sqlite'));
    return NativeDatabase(file);
  });
}

@DriftDatabase(tables: [Todos, Categories])
class MyDatabase extends _$MyDatabase {
  // we tell the database where to store the data with this constructor
  MyDatabase() : super(_openConnection());

  // you should bump this number whenever you change or add a table definition. Migrations
  // are covered later in this readme.
  @override
  int get schemaVersion => 1;
}
```

Congratulations! You're now ready to use all of drift. See the articles below for further reading.
The ["Writing queries"]({{ "writing_queries.md" | pageUrl }}) article contains everything you need
to know to write selects, updates and inserts in drift!

{% block "blocks/alert" title="Using the database" %}
> The database class from this guide is ready to be used with your app.
  For Flutter apps, a Drift database class is typically instantiated at the top of your widget tree
  and then passed down with `provider` or `riverpod`.
  See [using the database]({{ '../faq.md#using-the-database' | pageUrl }}) for ideas on how to integrate
  Drift into your app's state management.

  The setup in this guide uses [platform channels](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/platform-integration/platform-channels),
  which are only available after running `runApp` by default.
  When using drift before your app is initialized, please call `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` before using
  the database to ensure that platform channels are ready.
