We have an [example in the repo](https://github.com/simolus3/drift/tree/master/moor_flutter/example), it's a simple todo list app,
written with drift. [Rody Davis](https://github.com/rodydavis) has built a cleaner version of the example that works on all
Flutter platforms - including Web and Desktop! You can check it out [here](https://github.com/rodydavis/moor_shared).
An updated version of this example is also present in drift's [repository](https://github.com/simolus3/drift/tree/develop/examples/app).
[Abdelrahman Mostafa Elmarakby](https://github.com/abdelrahmanelmarakby) wrote an animated version of the todo app available [here](https://github.com/abdelrahmanelmarakby/todo_with_moor_and_animation).

The [HackerNews reader app](https://github.com/filiph/hn_app) from the [Boring Flutter Show](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjxrf2q8roU3ahJVrSgAnPjzkpGmL9Czl) also uses drift to keep a list of favorite articles.
