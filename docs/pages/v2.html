## Generator overhaul

The rewritten compiler is faster than ever, supports more SQL features and gives you
more flexibility when writing database code.

[Check the updated documentation]({{ "docs/SQL API/drift_files.md" | pageUrl }})

{% block "blocks/section" color="light" %}
{% block "blocks/feature" icon="fas fa-database" title="Pure SQL API" %} {% block "blocks/markdown" %}
The new `.moor` files have been updated and can now hold both `CREATE TABLE` statements
and queries you define. Moor will then generate type-safe Dart APIs based on your tables
and statements.

{% block "blocks/feature" icon="fas fa-plus" title="Analyzer improvements" %} {% block "blocks/markdown" %}
We now support more advanced features like compound select statements and window functions,
including detailed static analysis and lints. The updated type inference engine provides
better results on complex expressions. We also generate simpler methods for queries that only
return one column.

{% block "blocks/feature" icon="fas fa-code-branch" title="Dart-SQL interop" %} {% block "blocks/markdown" %}
Declare tables in Dart, write your queries in SQL. Or do it the other way around. Or do it all in Dart.
Or all in SQL. Moor makes writing database code fun without taking control over your code. 
For maximum flexibility, moor lets you inline Dart expressions into SQL and use the best of both
worlds.

## Builtin SQL IDE

Moor 2.0 expands the previous SQL parser and analyzer, providing real-time feedback on your
SQL queries as you type. Moor plugs right into the Dart analysis server, so you don't have
to install any additional extensions.

{% block "blocks/feature" icon="fas fa-exclamation-circle" title="Smart warnings" %} {% block "blocks/markdown" %}
![](warning.png)

Moor analyzes statements as you write them and reports errors right away. 
This helps you identify problems fast, without having to open your app.

{% block "blocks/feature" icon="fas fa-exclamation" title="Removed deprecated features" %} {% block "blocks/markdown" %}
We removed a whole bunch of deprecated apis that made it harder to develop new features.

{% block "blocks/feature" icon="fas fa-bolt" title="Experimental `dart:ffi` bindings" %} {% block "blocks/markdown" %}
The new [moor_ffi](https://pub.dev/packages/moor_ffi) package brings moor to the desktop and is up to 500x faster than the old
implementation.
