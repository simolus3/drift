description: Drift support in Flutter and Dart web apps.

!!! note ""

    
    __Good news__: With drift 2.9.0, web support is stable and officially supported!
    The `WasmDatabase.open` API is the preferred way to run drift on the web. While older
    APIs continue to work, using the stable API will bring performance and safety benefits.
    





Using modern browser APIs such as WebAssembly and the Origin-Private File System API,
you can use drift databases for the web version of your Flutter and Dart applications.
Just like the core drift APIs, web support is platform-agnostic:
Drift web supports Flutter Web, AngularDart, plain `dart:html` or any other Dart web framework.

While an official sqlite3 build for the web exists, it is fairly large and doesn't support most browsers.
Drift uses a custom sqlite3 build with a Dart interface sharing a lot of code with the existing native
platforms, which enables a fast implementation that works on more browsers.

## Supported browsers

Drift uses the FileSystem Access API to store databases if it's available. Otherwise, it will fall back to
a slower implementation based on IndexedDb in a shared worker. This makes drift available on all modern browsers,
even ones that don't support the official sqlite3 build for the web.
In some browsers, you need to serve your app with [additional COOP/COEP headers](#additional-headers) for full support (but drift works without that too - the official sqlite3 build doesn't).

| Supported Browser                               | With [security headers](#additional-headers) | Without security headers         |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Firefox _(tested version 114)_                  | Full                                         | Full                             |
| Chrome _(tested version 114)_                   | Full                                         | Good (slightly slower)           |
| Chrome on Android _(tested version 114)_        | Full                                         | Limited (not with multiple tabs) |
| Safari (_tested version 16.2_)                  | Good (slightly slower)                       | Good (slightly slower)           |
| Safari Technology Preview _(tested 172 (17.0))_ | Full                                         | Good                             |

Firefox currently doesn't support the FileSystem Access API in private browsing windows
(IndexedDB is supported from version 115). So drift will fall back to an IndexedDb-based
or an in-memory database in private tabs.

In Chrome on Android, shared workers aren't supported. So if the [headers](#additional-headers) required
for the preferred API are missing, there unfortunately is no way to prevent data races between tabs,
which can lead to persistence issues. Drift informs you about the chosen storage mode, so depending on
how critical persistence is to your app, you can instruct users to download a native app or use a different
browser in that case.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

On all platforms, drift requires access to [sqlite3](https://sqlite.org/index.html), the popular
database system written as a C library.
On native platforms, drift can use the sqlite3 library from your operating system. Flutter apps
typically include a more recent version of that library with the `sqlite3_flutter_libs` package too.

Web browsers don't have builtin access to the sqlite3 library, so it needs to be included with your app.
The `sqlite3` Dart package (used by drift internally) contains a toolchain to compile sqlite3 to WebAssembly
so that it can be used in browsers. You can grab a prebuilt `sqlite3.wasm` file from [its releases page](https://github.com/simolus3/sqlite3.dart/releases),
or [compile it yourself](#compilation).
This file needs to be put into the `web/` directory of your app.

Drift on the web also requires you to include a portion of drift as a web worker. This worker will be used to
host your database in a background thread, improving performance of your website. In some [storage implementations](#supported-storage-implementations),
the worker is also responsible for sharing your database between different tabs in real-time.
Again, you can [compile this worker yourself](#compilation) or [grab one from drift releases](https://github.com/simolus3/drift/releases).

In the end, your `web/` directory may look like this:

```
web/
├── favicon.png
├── index.html
├── manifest.json
├── drift_worker.dart.js
└── sqlite3.wasm
```

!!! info "Serving wasm files"

    
    For browsers to accept the `sqlite3.wasm` file, it must be served with
    `Content-Type: application/wasm`.
    `flutter run` does this by default, but some webservers might not. After
    deploying your app to the web, check that your server is configured to send the
    correct `Content-Type` header for wasm files.
    



#### Additional headers

On browsers that support it, drift uses the origin-private part of the [FileSystem Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API) to store databases efficiently.
As parts of that API are asynchronous, and since sqlite3 expectes a synchronous file system, we need to
use two workers with shared memory and `Atomics.wait`/`notify`.
Just like the official sqlite3 port to the web, __this requires your website to be served with two special headers__:

- `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`: Needs to be set to `same-origin`.
- `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy`: Needs to be set to `require-corp` or `credentialless`.

For more details, see the [security requirements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer) explained by MDN, and the [documentation on web.dev](https://web.dev/coop-coep/).
You can use ``flutter run  --web-header=Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy=same-origin --web-header=Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy=require-corp`` to add these headers onto `flutter run`'s web server.
However, if you use `flutter run` just like always Drift will fall back to a (slightly slower) implementation (see [storages](#supported-storage-implementations)).
We recommend researching and enabling these headers in production, too, if possible.

Also, note that the `sqlite3.wasm` file needs to be served with a `Content-Type` of
`application/wasm` since browsers will reject the module otherwise.

!!! danger "Downsides of COOP and COEP"

    
    While these headers are required for the origin-private FileSystem Access API
    and bring a security benefit, there are some known problems:
    
    - These headers are incompatible with some other packages opening popups,
    such as the ones used for [Google Auth](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/get-google-api-clientid?hl=en#cross_origin_opener_policy).
    - Safari 16 has an [unfortunate bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=245346)
    preventing dedicated workers to be loaded from cache with these headers. However, shared and service workers
    are unaffected by this.
    
    Please carefully test your app with these headers to evaluate whether you might
    be affected by these limitations.
    If the headers break your app, you should not enable them - drift will fall back
    to another (potentially slower) implementation in that case.
    



### Setup in Dart

From a perspective of the Dart code used, drift on the web is similar to drift on other platforms.
You can follow the [getting started guide](../setup.md) as a general setup guide.

Instead of using a `NativeDatabase` in your database classes, you can use the `WasmDatabase` optimized for
the web:

{{ load_snippet('connect','lib/snippets/platforms/web.dart.excerpt.json') }}

When you call `WasmDatabase.open`, drift will automatically find a suitable persistence implementation
supported by the current browser.

A full example that works on the web (and all other platforms supported by drift) is available
[here](https://github.com/simolus3/drift/tree/develop/examples/app).

## Sharing code between native apps and web

If you want to share your database code between native applications and web apps, import only the
core `package:drift/drift.dart` library into your database file.
And instead of passing a `NativeDatabase` or `WebDatabase` to the `super` constructor, make the
`QueryExecutor` customizable:

```dart
// don't import drift/web.dart or drift/native.dart in shared code
import 'package:drift/drift.dart';

@DriftDatabase(/* ... */)
class SharedDatabase extends _$SharedDatabase {
    SharedDatabase(QueryExecutor e): super(e);
}
```

In native Flutter apps, you can create an instance of your database with

```dart
// native.dart
import 'package:drift/native.dart';

SharedDatabase constructDb() {
  final db = LazyDatabase(() async {
    final dbFolder = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
    final file = File(p.join(dbFolder.path, 'db.sqlite'));
    return NativeDatabase(file);
  });
  return SharedDatabase(db);
}
```

On the web, you can use

```dart
// web.dart
import 'package:drift/web.dart';

SharedDatabase constructDb() {
  return SharedDatabase(connectOnWeb());
}
```

Finally, we can use [conditional imports](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/create-library-packages#conditionally-importing-and-exporting-library-files)
to automatically pick the right `constructDb` function based on where your app runs.
To do this, first create a `unsupported.dart` default implementation:

```dart
// unsupported.dart
SharedDatabase constructDb() => throw UnimplementedError();
```

Now, we can use conditional imports in a `shared.dart` file to export the correct function:

```dart
// shared.dart
export 'unsupported.dart'
  if (dart.library.ffi) 'native.dart'
  if (dart.library.html) 'web.dart';
```

A ready example of this construct can also be found [here](https://github.com/simolus3/drift/blob/develop/examples/app/lib/database/connection/connection.dart).

## Using existing databases

You can use existing database with Drift on the web by importing the `initializeDatabase`
function on `WasmDatabase.open`.
This function will be called when attempting to open a database that doesn't exist yet,
allowing the initial sqlite3 file to be provided instead:

{{ load_snippet('existing','lib/snippets/platforms/web.dart.excerpt.json') }}

Please be aware that this only works for the default journal mode, WAL is not supported
on the web and WAL databases can't be imported with `initializeDatabase` either.

## Examples

The drift repository contains a two small web applications using drift on the web:

- A cross-platform Flutter app with web support ([source code](https://github.com/simolus3/drift/tree/develop/examples/app)).

If you have a cool open-source web application using drift, we'd love to list it here as well. Feel free to open a PR!

## Advanced uses

### Supported storage implementations 

When opening a database, drift determines the state of a number of web APIs in the current browser.
It then picks a suitable database storage based on what the current browser supports.
The following implementation strategies are supported by drift (listed in order of descending preference).
You can view the chosen strategy via the `WasmDatabaseResult.chosenImplementation` returned by
`WasmDatabase.open`.

1. `opfsShared`: Uses the origin-private filesystem access API in a shared web worker.
   As this API is only available in dedicated web workers, this requires shared workers to be able to
   spawn dedicated workers. While allowed by the web standards, this is only implemented by Firefox.
2. `opfsLocks`: Uses the origin-private filesystem access API, but without shared workers.
   This requires the [COOP and COEP headers](#additional-headers).
3. `sharedIndexedDb`: Uses IndexedDB to store chunks of data, the database is hosted in a shared web worker.
4. `unsafeIndexedDb`: This also uses the IndexedDB database, but without a shared worker or another
   means of synchronization between tabs. In this mode, __it is not safe for multiple tabs of your app
   to access the same database__.
   While this was the default mode used by earlier implementations of drift for the web, we now try to
   avoid it and it will not be used on modern browsers.
5. `inMemory`: When no persistence API is available, drift will fall back to an in-memory database.

The missing browser APIs contributing to a specific implementation being chosen are available in
`WasmDatabaseResult.missingFeatures`.
There's nothing your app or drift could do about them. If persistence is important to your app
and drift has chosen the `unsafeIndexedDb` or the `inMemory` implementation due to a lack of proper
persistence support, you may want to show a warning to the user explaining that they have to upgrade
their browser.

### Custom functions and database setup

Constructors on `NativeDatabase` have a `setup` callback used to initialize the raw database instance,
for instance by registering custom functions that are needed on the database.
Unfortunately, this cannot be supported by `WasmDatabase.open` directly. Since the raw database instance
may only exist on a web worker, we can't use Dart callback functions.

However, it is possible to compile a custom worker that will setup drift databases it creates. For that,
you can create a Dart file (usually put into `web/`) with content like:

{{ load_snippet('setupAll','lib/snippets/platforms/web.dart.excerpt.json') }}

To open the database from the application, you can then use this:

{{ load_snippet('setupLocal','lib/snippets/platforms/web.dart.excerpt.json') }}

The `setupDatabase` value is duplicated with `localSetup` in case drift determines that it needs to use
an in-memory database or an IndexedDB-powered database that doesn't run in a worker. In that case,
`localSetup` would get called instead. For databases running in a worker, the worker calls `setupAllDatabases`
which creates the necessary functions.

The next section explains how to compile the Dart file calling `workerMainForOpen` into a JavaScript
worker that can be referenced with `driftWorkerUri`.
There is no need to compile a custom `sqlite3.wasm` for this.

### Compilation

Drift and the `sqlite3` Dart package provide pre-compiled versions of the worker and the WebAssembly
module for your convenience.
If you want to instead compile these yourself, this section describes how to do that.

The web worker is written in Dart - the entrypoint is stable and part of drift's public API.
To compile a worker suitable for `WasmDatabase.open`, create a new Dart file that calls `WasmDatabase.workerMainForOpen`:


{{ load_snippet('(full)','lib/snippets/platforms/stable_worker.dart.excerpt.json') }}

The JavaScript file included in drift releases is compiled with `dart compile js -O4 web/drift_worker.dart`.
You can use that command or a tool such as `build_web_compilers` to compile this worker.
Be aware that `dart2js` needs to be used as a compiler. `dartdevc` generates modules which are unsuitable
for workers without additional setup.

Compiling the `sqlite3.wasm` file requires a C toolchain capable of compiling to WebAssembly.
On Arch Linux, I'm using `clang` with the `wasi-compiler-rt` and `wasi-libc` pacakges.
Depending on your distribution, you may have to compile the [wasi-sdk](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk) or
another toolchain yourself.
Finally, we're also using [binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) as an optimizer.

The repository for the `sqlite3` package contains CMake buildscripts to compile sqlite3. Thus, you can compile
the file like this:

```
git clone https://github.com/simolus3/sqlite3.dart.git
cd sqlite3.dart/sqlite3

cmake -S assets/wasm -B .dart_tool/sqlite3_build --toolchain toolchain.cmake
cmake --build .dart_tool/sqlite3_build/ -t output -j
```

This will output two files to `example/web`: `sqlite3.wasm` and `sqlite3.debug.wasm`. The former is suitable
for use in applications. The debug variant prints file system invocations to the console for debugging purposes.
I mainly use it when working on the low-level Dart bindings, it is probably not too useful for application
developers.

### Migrating from existing web databases

`WasmDatabase.open` is drift's stable web API, which has been built with the lessons learned from previous
web APIs available in drift (that have always been marked as `@experimental`). You can use `WasmDatabase.open`
to replace the following drift APIs:

1. The sql.js-based implementation in `package:drift/web.dart`.
2. Custom `WasmDatabase` constructions that manually load sqlite3.
3. Custom worker setups created with `package:drift/web/worker.dart`.

Let's start with the good news: After migrating to `WasmDatabase.open`, drift will manage workers for you.
It automatically uses the best worker setup supported by the current browsers, enabling the use of shared
and dedicated web workers where appropriate.
So the migration from `package:drift/web/worker.dart` is to just stop using that API, since you get all of
its features out of the box with `WasmDatabase.open`.

### Migrating from custom `WasmDatabase`s

In older drift versions, you may have used a custom setup that loaded the WASM binary manually, created
a `CommonSqlite3` instance with it and passed that to `WasmDatabase`.

{{ load_snippet('migrate-wasm','lib/snippets/platforms/web.dart.excerpt.json') }}

### Migrating from `package:drift/web.dart`

To migrate from a `WebDatabase` to the new setup, you can use the `initializeDatabase` callback.
It is invoked when opening the database if no file exists yet. By loading the old database there,
it is migrated to the new format without data loss:

{{ load_snippet('migrate-legacy','lib/snippets/platforms/web.dart.excerpt.json') }}

In that snippet, `old_db` is the name previously passed to the `WebDatabase`.

## Legacy web support

Drift first gained its initial web support in 2019 by wrapping the sql.js JavaScript library.
This implementation, which is still supported today, relies on keeping an in-memory database that is periodically saved to local storage.
In the last years, development in web browsers and the Dart ecosystem enabled more performant approaches that are
unfortunately impossible to implement with the original drift web API.
This is the reason the original API is still considered experimental - while it will continue to be supported, it is now obvious that the new approach by `WasmDatabase.open` is sound and more efficient
than these implementations.
The original APIs are still documented on this page for your reference.

### Debugging
You can see all queries sent from drift to the underlying database engine by enabling the `logStatements`
parameter on the `WebDatabase` - they will appear in the console.
When you have assertions enabled (e.g. in debug mode), drift will expose the underlying
[database](https://sql.js.org/documentation/Database.html)
object via `window.db`. If you need to quickly run a query to check the state of the database, you can use
`db.exec(sql)`.
If you need to delete your databases, there stored using local storage. You can clear all your data with `localStorage.clear()`.

Web support is now stable, but please continue to [report all issues](https://github.com/simolus3/drift/issues/new) you find.

### Using IndexedDb

The default `WebDatabase` uses local storage to store the raw sqlite database file. On browsers that support it, you can also
use `IndexedDb` to store that blob. In general, browsers allow a larger size for `IndexedDb`. The implementation is also more
performant, since we don't have to encode binary blobs as strings.

To use this implementation on browsers that support it, replace `WebDatabase(name)` with:

```dart
WebDatabase.withStorage(await DriftWebStorage.indexedDbIfSupported(name))
```

Drift will automatically migrate data from local storage to `IndexedDb` when it is available.


#### Using web workers

You can offload the database to a background thread by using
[Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API).
Drift also supports [shared workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker),
which allows you to seamlessly synchronize query-streams and updates across multiple tabs!

Since web workers can't use local storage, you need to use `DriftWebStorage.indexedDb` instead of
the regular implementation.

The following example is meant to be used with a regular Dart web app, compiled using
[build_web_compilers](https://pub.dev/packages/build_web_compilers).
A Flutter port of this example is [part of the drift repository](https://github.com/simolus3/drift/tree/drift-2.19.2/examples/flutter_web_worker_example).

To write a web worker that will serve requests for drift, create a file called `worker.dart` in
the `web/` folder of your app. It could have the following content:



{{ load_snippet('worker','lib/snippets/platforms/workers.dart.excerpt.json') }}

For more information on this api, see the [remote API](https://pub.dev/documentation/drift/latest/remote/remote-library.html).

Connecting to that worker is very simple with drift's web and remote apis. In your regular app code (outside of the worker),
you can connect like this:

{{ load_snippet('client','lib/snippets/platforms/workers.dart.excerpt.json') }}

You can then open a drift database with that connection.
For more information on the `DatabaseConnection` class, see the documentation on
[isolates](../isolates.md).

A small, but working example is available under [examples/web_worker_example](https://github.com/simolus3/drift/tree/drift-2.19.2/examples/web_worker_example)
in the drift repository.

#### Flutter
Flutter users will have to use a different approach to compile service workers.
Flutter web doesn't compile `.dart` files in web folder and won't use `.js` files generated by
`build_web_compilers` either. Instead, we'll use Dart's build system to manually compile the worker to a
JavaScript file before using Flutter-specific tooling.

Example is available under [examples/flutter_web_worker_example](https://github.com/simolus3/drift/tree/drift-2.19.2/examples/flutter_web_worker_example)
in the drift repository.

First, add [build_web_compilers](https://pub.dev/packages/build_web_compilers) to the project:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  build_web_compilers: ^3.2.1
```

Inside a `build.yaml` file, the compilers can be configured to always use `dart2js` (a good choice for web workers).
Add these lines to `build.yaml`:

```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      build_web_compilers:entrypoint:
        generate_for:
          - web/**.dart
        options:
          compiler: dart2js
        dev_options:
          dart2js_args:
            - --no-minify
        release_options:
          dart2js_args:
            - -O4
```

Now, run the compiler and copy the compiled worker JS files to `web/`:

```shell
#Debug mode
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs -o web:build/web/
cp -f build/web/worker.dart.js web/worker.dart.js
```

```shell
#Release mode
dart run build_runner build --release --delete-conflicting-outputs -o web:build/web/
cp -f build/web/worker.dart.js web/worker.dart.min.js
```

Finally, use this to connect to a worker:

```dart
import 'dart:js_interop';

import 'package:drift/drift.dart';
import 'package:drift/remote.dart';
import 'package:drift/web.dart';
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
import 'package:web/web.dart';

DatabaseConnection connectToWorker(String databaseName) {
  final worker = SharedWorker(
      (kReleaseMode ? 'worker.dart.min.js' : 'worker.dart.js').toJS,
      databaseName.toJS);

  return DatabaseConnection.delayed(
      connectToRemoteAndInitialize(worker.port.channel()));
}
```

You can pass that `DatabaseConnection` to the constructor of your database class.
