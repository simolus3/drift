description: Options for `drift_dev` and `build_runner` to change the generated code.

---

The `drift_dev` package supports a range of options that control how code
is generated.
In most cases, the default settings should be sufficient. But if you want to
try out new features faster or configure how drift-generated code looks like,
you can use the available options listed below.
You can also see the section on [recommended options](#recommended-options) for
advice on which options to use.

To use the options, create a `build.yaml` file in the root of your project (e.g. next
to your `pubspec.yaml`):

```yaml
# build.yaml. This file is quite powerful, see https://pub.dev/packages/build_config

targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      drift_dev:
        options:
          store_date_time_values_as_text: true
```

## Available options

At the moment, drift supports these options:

- `write_from_json_string_constructor`: boolean. Adds a `.fromJsonString` factory
  constructor to generated data classes. By default, we only write a `.fromJson`
  constructor that takes a `Map<String, dynamic>`.
- `override_hash_and_equals_in_result_sets`: boolean. When drift generates another class
  to hold the result of generated select queries, this flag controls whether drift should
  override `operator ==` and `hashCode` in those classes. In recent versions, it will also
  override `toString` if this option is enabled.
- `skip_verification_code`: Generated tables contain a significant chunk of code to verify integrity
  of inserted data and report detailed errors when the integrity is violated. If you're only using
  inserts with SQL, or don't need this functionality, enabling this flag can help to reduce the amount
  generated code.
- `use_data_class_name_for_companions`: By default, the name for [companion classes](../dart_api/writes.md#updates-and-deletes)
  is based on the table name (e.g. a `@DataClassName('Users') class UsersTable extends Table` would generate
  a `UsersTableCompanion`). With this option, the name is based on the data class (so `UsersCompanion` in
  this case).
- `use_column_name_as_json_key_when_defined_in_moor_file` (defaults to `true`): When serializing columns declared inside a
  `.drift` file from and to json, use their sql name instead of the generated Dart getter name
  (so a column named `user_name` would also use `user_name` as a json key instead of `userName`).
  You can always override the json key by using a `JSON KEY` column constraint
  (e.g. `user_name VARCHAR NOT NULL JSON KEY userName`).
- `use_sql_column_name_as_json_key` (defaults to false): Uses the column name in SQL as the JSON key for serialization,
  regardless of whether the table was defined in a drift file or not.
- `generate_connect_constructor` (deprecated): Generates a named `connect()` constructor on database classes
  that takes a `DatabaseConnection` instead of a `QueryExecutor`.
  This option was deprecated in drift 2.5 because `DatabaseConnection` now implements `QueryExecutor`.
- `data_class_to_companions` (defaults to `true`): Controls whether drift will write the `toCompanion` method in generated
  data classes.
- `mutable_classes` (defaults to `false`): The fields generated in generated data, companion and result set classes are final
  by default. You can make them mutable by setting `mutable_classes: true`.
- `raw_result_set_data`: The generator will expose the underlying `QueryRow` for generated result set classes
- `apply_converters_on_variables` (defaults to `true`): Applies type converters to variables in compiled statements.
- `generate_values_in_copy_with` (defaults to `true`): Generates a `Value<T?>` instead of `T?` for nullable columns in `copyWith`. This allows to set
  columns back to null (by using `Value(null)`). Passing `null` was ignored before, making it impossible to set columns
  to `null`.
- `named_parameters`: Generates named parameters for named variables in SQL queries.
- `named_parameters_always_required`: All named parameters (generated if `named_parameters` option is `true`) will be required in Dart.
- `scoped_dart_components` (defaults to `true`): Generates a function parameter for [Dart placeholders](../sql_api/drift_files.md#dart-components-in-sql) in SQL.
  The function has a parameter for each table that is available in the query, making it easier to get aliases right when using
  Dart placeholders.
- `store_date_time_values_as_text`: Whether date-time columns should be stored as ISO 8601 string instead of a unix timestamp.
  For more information on these modes, see [datetime options](../dart_api/tables.md#datetime-options).
- `case_from_dart_to_sql` (defaults to `snake_case`): Controls how the table and column names are re-cased from the Dart identifiers.
  The possible values are `preserve`, `camelCase`, `CONSTANT_CASE`, `snake_case`, `PascalCase`, `lowercase` and `UPPERCASE` (default: `snake_case`).
- `write_to_columns_mixins`: Whether the `toColumns` method should be written as a mixin instead of being added directly to the data class.
  This is useful when using [existing row classes](../dart_api/dataclass.md#custom-dataclass), as the mixin is generated for those as well.
- `has_separate_analyzer`: This option is only relevant when using the `drift_dev:not_shared` builder, which needs to use a less efficient
  analysis implementation than the other builders by default. After also applying `drift_dev:analyzer` to the same build target, this option
  can be enabled to speed up builds. This option has no effect with the default or the modular builder.
- `fatal_warnings`: When enabled (defaults to `false`), warnings found by `drift_dev` in the build process (like syntax errors in SQL queries or
  unresolved references in your Dart tables) will cause the build to fail.
- `preamble`: This option is useful when using drift as a standalone part "../Generation options"builder or when running a
  modular build. In these setups, the `preamble` option defined by the [source_gen package](https://pub.dev/packages/source_gen#preamble)
  would have no effect, which is why it has been added as an option for the drift builders.
- `generate_manager`: When enabled (defaults to `true`), managers will be generated for each table in the database. These managers help perform simple actions without boilerplate.

## Assumed SQL environment

You can configure the SQL dialect you want to target with the `sql` build option.
When using sqlite, you can further configure the assumed sqlite3 version and enabled
extensions for more accurate analysis.

Note that these options are used for static analysis only and don't have an impact on the
actual sqlite version at runtime.

To define the sqlite version to use, set `sqlite.version` to the `major.minor`
version:

```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      drift_dev:
        options:
          sql:
            dialect: sqlite
            options:
              version: "3.34"
```

With that option, the generator will emit warnings when using features introduced
in more recent sqlite versions.
For instance, using more than one [upsert clause](https://sqlite.org/lang_upsert.html) is not supported
in 3.34, so an error would be reported.
Currently, the generator can't provide compatibility checks for versions below 3.34, which is the
minimum version needed in options.

### Multi-dialect code generation

Thanks to community contributions, drift has in-progress support for Postgres and MariaDB.
You can change the `dialect` option to `postgres` or `mariadb` to generate code for those
database management systems.

In some cases, your generated code might have to support more than one DBMS. For instance,
you might want to share database code between your backend and a Flutter app. Or maybe
you're writing a server that should be able to talk to both MariaDB and Postgres, depending
on what the operator prefers.
Drift can generate code for multiple dialects - in that case, the right SQL will be chosen
at runtime when it makes a difference.

To enable this feature, remove the `dialect` option in the `sql` block and replace it with
a list of `dialects`:

```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      drift_dev:
        options:
          sql:
            dialects:
              - sqlite
              - postgres
            options:
              version: "3.34"
```

### Available extensions

**Note**: This enables extensions in the analyzer for custom queries only. For instance, when the `json1` extension is
enabled, the [`json`](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html) functions can be used in drift files. This doesn't necessarily
mean that those functions are supported at runtime! Both extensions are available on iOS 11 or later. On Android, they're
only available when using a `NativeDatabase`.

```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      drift_dev:
        options:
          sql:
            dialect: sqlite
            options:
              modules:
                - json1
                - fts5
                - math
```

We currently support the following extensions:

- [json1](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html): Support static analysis for `json_` functions in moor files
- [fts5](https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html): Support `CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE` statements for `fts5` tables and the `MATCH` operator.
  Functions like `highlight` or `bm25` are available as well.
- `rtree`: Static analysis support for the [R\*Tree](https://www.sqlite.org/rtree.html) extension.
  Enabling this option is safe when using a `NativeDatabase` with `sqlite3_flutter_libs`,
  which compiles sqlite3 with the R*Tree extension enabled.
- [geopoly](https://www.sqlite.org/geopoly.html), a generalization of the R*Tree module supporting more complex
  polygons. Note that this is not the case for most sqlite3 builds,
  including the ones shipping with `sqlite3_flutter_libs`.
- `moor_ffi`: Enables support for functions that are only available when using a `NativeDatabase`. This contains `pow`, `sqrt` and a variety
  of trigonometric functions. Details on those functions are available [here](../Platforms/vm.md#drift-only-functions).
- `math`: Assumes that sqlite3 was compiled with [math functions](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_mathfunc.html).
  This module is largely incompatible with the `moor_ffi` module.
- `spellfix1`: Assumes that the [spellfix1](https://www.sqlite.org/spellfix1.html)
  module is available. Note that this is not the case for most sqlite3 builds,
  including the ones shipping with `sqlite3_flutter_libs`.

### Known custom functions

The `modules` options can be used to tell drift's analyzer that a well-known
sqlite3 extension is available at runtime. In some backends (like a `NativeDatabase`),
it is also possible to specify entirely custom functions.

To be able to use these functions in `.drift` files, you can tell drift's
analyzer about them. To do so, add a `known_functions` block to the options:

```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      drift_dev:
        options:
          sql:
            dialect: sqlite
            options:
              known_functions:
                my_function: "boolean (text, int null)"
```

With these options, drift will analyze queries under the assumption that a SQL
function called `my_function` taking a non-nullable textual value an a nullable
integer will return a non-null value that drift can interpret as a boolean.

The syntax for a function type is defined as `<return type> (<argument types>)`.
Each type consists of an arbitrary word used to determine [column affinity](https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#determination_of_column_affinity),
with drift also supporting `DATETIME` and `BOOLEAN` as type hints. Then, the
optional `NULL` keyword can be used to indicate whether the type is nullable.

## Recommended options

In general, we recommend using the default options.

<!-- However, some options will be enabled by default in a future drift release.
At the moment, they're opt-in to not break existing users. These options are:

(Currently all recommended options are also the default)

We recommend enabling these options. -->


However, you can disable some default drift features and reduce the amount of generated code with the following options:

- `skip_verification_code: true`: You can remove a significant portion of generated code with this option. The
  downside is that error messages when inserting invalid data will be less specific.
- `data_class_to_companions: false`: Don't generate the `toCompanion` method on data classes. If you don't need that
  method, you can disable this option.
