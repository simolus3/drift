description: Example apps using moor
---


We have an [example in the repo](https://github.com/simolus3/moor/tree/master/moor_flutter/example), it's a simple todo list app,
written with moor. [Rody Davis](https://github.com/rodydavis) has built a cleaner version of the example that works on all
Flutter platforms - including Web and Desktop! You can check it out [here](https://github.com/rodydavis/moor_shared).

The [HackerNews reader app](https://github.com/filiph/hn_app) from the [Boring Flutter Show](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjxrf2q8roU3ahJVrSgAnPjzkpGmL9Czl) also uses moor to keep a list of favorite articles.
